# Holberton School - AirBnb clone

### Project description

AirBnB clone project as part of a Holberton School project.
The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
All the features are not implemented but you will find the most important

The following elements compose the AirBnb clone and can be found in the repository files :

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

### Console application

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

Here is the list of commands available in the console, followed by examples to guide you in its handling :
